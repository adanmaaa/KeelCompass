Simplified Education Portal

This is a simplified version of an education portal using HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.

Features

1. Educational Content
   - View articles, guides, study tips, and learning strategies.
   - Search functionality to find articles based on keywords.

2. Bookmarking System
   - Users can bookmark articles using localStorage.

3. Educational Tools
   - Static list of external educational resources (e.g., Khan Academy, Coursera).

Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles content display, bookmarks, and search.
- `db schema.sql`: SQL schema for the educational content and bookmarks (for future use with a backend).
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.


How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.
3. Use the search bar to filter articles by keywords.
4. Bookmark articles and view them under the article list.

Future Improvements

- Add a backend (e.g., PHP, Node.js) to interact with a real database using SQL.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access.
- Allow dynamic content addition and management from the backend.
